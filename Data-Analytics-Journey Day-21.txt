1)Window Functions in SQL:
=========================
Go beyond GROUP BY with window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE()).

Example: Find the top 3 salespersons in each region without collapsing data.

2)Running Totals & Moving Averages:
=================================
Use SUM() OVER (ORDER BY ...) to calculate cumulative sales.

Example: Monthly sales growth trend for performance tracking.

3)LEAD & LAG Functions:
======================
Compare current row values with previous/next row.

Example: Find month-over-month sales difference for each product.

4)SQL CTEs (Common Table Expressions):
===================================
Write cleaner, modular queries using WITH.

Example: Create a CTE to calculate intermediate results (like active users) and reuse it in final queries.

5)Case Study: Customer Retention Analysis:
=======================================
Combine window functions + CTEs to analyze churned vs retained customers over months.

Real-world use: SaaS platforms tracking subscription renewals.
